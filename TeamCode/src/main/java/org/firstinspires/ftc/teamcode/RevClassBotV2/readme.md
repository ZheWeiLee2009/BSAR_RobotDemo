Rev ClassBot V2 is a robot developed by the hardware provider REV Robotics.

## How to use

1. The robot should be orientated from the motors being at the front.
2. Make sure the motors are named with "leftMotor" and "rightMotor" as the default.
3. Following the steps from [How to use](../../../../../../../../../README.md#How-to-use), upload the code
4. Connect the controllers and play!

## Known Issues

- Some robot would turn inverted in some of the robots. 
  - Created 3 other duplicates of original file that have different styles of control to control the robot.
  - 
  - This is most likely caused by a configuration issue with wiring of the robot and the config of the motors.

## Future plans:

- Planning on adding a master configuration file for each of the demo robots.
