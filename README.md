## Welcome!

This repository is for Robot Demonstrations and other outreach presentations. 
It should include all of the code needed to operate the Demo robots.

## Notice 

This repository contains Version 9.1 code from this repository: [FtcRobotController](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/).


## Getting Started
If you are new to robotics or new to the *FIRST* Tech Challenge, then you should consider reviewing the [FTC Blocks Tutorial](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/programming_resources/blocks/Blocks-Tutorial.html) to get familiar with how to use the control system:

`[FTC Blocks Online Tutorial](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/programming_resources/blocks/Blocks-Tutorial.html)`

Even if you are an advanced Java programmer, it is helpful to start with the [FTC Blocks tutorial](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/programming_resources/blocks/Blocks-Tutorial.html), and then migrate to the [OnBot Java Tool](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/programming_resources/onbot_java/OnBot-Java-Tutorial.html) or to [Android Studio](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/programming_resources/android_studio_java/Android-Studio-Tutorial.html) afterwards.

## Downloading the Project
If you are an Android Studio programmer, there are several ways to download this repo.  Note that if you use the Blocks or OnBot Java Tool to program your robot, then you do not need to download this repository.

* If you are a git user, you can clone the most current version of the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController.git`

* Or, if you prefer, you can use the "Download Zip" button available through the main repository page.  Downloading the project as a .ZIP file will keep the size of the download manageable.

Once you have downloaded and uncompressed (if needed) your folder, you can use Android Studio to import the folder  ("Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)").

## How to use

To use this code, you'll need:
> An operating system that supports Android Studio [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install "Download for Android Studio")
> 
> Rev Hardware Client installed. [Rev Hardware Client](https://docs.revrobotics.com/rev-hardware-client/gs/install "Download for Android Studio")
> 
> An operable robot that is updated to the most current version

1. git clone this repository to your local computer 
   - `git clone git@github.com:ZheWeiLee2009/BSAR_RobotDemo.git` 
2. Find the repository on your computer and open with Android Studio
3. Build the code
4. Connect the robot using the internet
5. Check the connection with the robot through Rev Hardware Client
   - If the operating system on the robot controller isn't updated, please update to the latest version
6. After checking the connection, click on the option for the control hub ![Connection](/assets/images/Screenshot%20from%202024-06-28%2001-15-06.png)
7. Build onto the robot!
8. Check the Robot, if the code shows then **SUCCESS!**

## Getting Help

### Sample OpModes
This project contains a large selection of Sample OpModes (robot code examples) which can be cut and pasted into your /teamcode folder to be used as-is, or modified to suit your team's needs.

Samples Folder: &nbsp;&nbsp; [/FtcRobotController/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotcontroller/external/samples](FtcRobotController/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotcontroller/external/samples)

The readme.md file located in the [/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode](TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode) folder contains an explanation of the sample naming convention, and instructions on how to copy them to your own project space.
